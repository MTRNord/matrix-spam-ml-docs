The Project features a Matrix Bot that behaves similar but also widely different to Mjolnir.

The aim of the Bot is to provide warnings to the Admin by default and be more human friendly in usage.

Some of the major changes to it compared to Mjolnir are:

- The Bot warns the Admins about possible spam actively
- Actions are mainly done via reactions
- The bot can automatically issue reports if an admin wants and the server previously was set up with contact info
- The bot has a split admin and a warning room. This allows admins to publish the warning room as a human readable banlist
- The bot does input validation
- The bot has only a few commands since the majority of actions is meant to happen using reactions
- The bot is using a ML model trained to detect spam
